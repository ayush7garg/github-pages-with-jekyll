# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Web development.

Web development is used to develop websites for companies, businesses, hotels etc and also for personal use to showcase your skills by developing websites for your resume, portfolio etc. The websites hence developed are later deployed on Internet so that the whole world can visit it.
